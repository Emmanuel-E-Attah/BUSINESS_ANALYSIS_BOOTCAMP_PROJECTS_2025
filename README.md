# BUSINESS_ANALYSIS_BOOTCAMP_PROJECTS_2025
Project Summary: Food Ordering Website
This project was completed as part of a 3-month IT Business Analysis bootcamp, where i gained hands-on experience using industry-standard tools and methodologies.
The goal was to simulate the end-to-end process of business analysis for an already existing Food Ordering Website needing improvement in three key aspects. 
The scope was limited to three aspects namely:
Online payment Integration,Menu management,Customer Feedback and Review System. Key activities included:
1.Business Requirements Documentation: Utilized Confluence to document the business requirements, ensuring all stakeholders' needs were captured effectively.
2.Agile Framework Implementation: Used Jira to create and manage Epics, User Stories, and Acceptance Criteria, aligning with Agile best Practices.
3.Process Mapping: Designed a comprehensive Process Mapping Diagram using Miro, visually representing the workflows and processes involved in the project.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in business analysis tools, requirements gathering, process mapping, and Agile methodologies.
